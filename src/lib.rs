//! `buffer` provides safe, write-only and generics-free byte buffers that can
//! be used without initializing them first.
//!
//! The main trait of this library is `Buffer` that represents a type that can
//! contain uninitialized bytes (such as `Vec`, `ArrayVec`, etc.) and can
//! safely be read into (e.g. using `ReadBuffer`).
//!
//! In order to keep code sizes down, such a type implementing `Buffer` is
//! quickly converted into the struct `BufferRef`, so this is the type
//! receivers of types implementing `Buffer`s should work with.
//!
//! An example for the usage of this trait can be found with `ReadBuffer` which
//! implements reading into a buffer without initializing it first.
